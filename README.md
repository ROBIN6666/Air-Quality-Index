Incase of any errors, please contact us at feedback@ndtv.com Air pollution in major cities across India reached alarming levels in the past week, particularly in Delhi where residents face a public health emergency. The national capital region has been shrouded in a thick blanket of smog, forcing most people to stay indoors. Flight operations at the Delhi airport were also affected due to the low visibility caused by the air pollution.   The Air Quality Index in Delhi dropped to 999 over the weekend, making it the most polluted capital city in the world. While the safe limit set by the World Health Organisation is 25, anything above 500 poses a serious risk to the respiratory systems of the general population.   Air Quality Index or AQI measures the concentration of PM 2.5 levels -- fine particles of less than 2.5 microns that can enter the bloodstream and penetrate the lungs and heart - which are linked to chronic respiratory diseases.
